cwm2 X11 WM

Next-gen *nix WM. 

This project has no relation to cwm. It is a new project formulated from scratch written in modern C for purity.
No BS abstraction, no BS OO. Cuts to the chase. Interfaces directly with Xlib. Correct, fast, lightweight.

Build prerequisites/deps:

BSD Make (bmake)  
libX11 (dev, devel)  
libXinerama (dev, devel)  
dbus-1 (dev, devel)

Target(s): BSD UNIX, Linux
